# LogScale-Package-for-Nextcloud

## Installing Nextcloud package
At some point, the package may be installable via the LogScale Marketplace.
Until that becomes an option, download the "nextcloud--nextcloud--x.x.x" zip file and install it by entering (or creating) a repository of choice, click "Settings", click "Installed" (the next to last option in the menu tree to the left), click "Import Package".
